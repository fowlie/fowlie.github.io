# About Me

<img src="/images/fowlie.png" class="img-thumbnail">

My passion for tech started when I wanted to build my own website at age 14. I quickly learned about HTML and JavaScript, then I touched into Perl, Pascal Delphi, and PHP. I took a bachelors degree in Embedded Systems at [HIBU](https://www.usn.no/om-hsn/campus/kongsberg) which focused on engineering, software and hardware.

I got my first developer job at an insurance company called If Insurance in 2008 where I developed an automated claims handling system on the [IBM WebSphere Process Server](https://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/wps) platform. 4 years later, I started in a new project writing real Java code with [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org), and I remember this was the point in my life that I reeeally started nerding about programming.

Another 4 years later, march 2016, I took a job at the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Here I'm developing in Ubuntu Linux, which is a totally different world than Windows, but so much better. I would never go back to Windows.
