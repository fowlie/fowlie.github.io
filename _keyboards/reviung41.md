The Reviung41 is part of the Reviung series which is not very often seen in the
wild for some reason. It's got a so called sandwich case, which is just three
layers of PCB. You can also fill the gaps with acrylic plates that shines
really cool with the LED lights. Its a monoblock design, so the build will cost
a little less than most splits since there is only one controller needed.
