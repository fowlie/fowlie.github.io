After my last blog post I gave up trying to find the perfect keymap layout.
There are so many pitfalls when designing a layered keyboard keymap,
and I just got tired of remapping keys all the time. So instead I tried to
adopt the [popular Miryoku layout](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku),
which is a 36 key layout that includes all keys from a full size keyboard in
addition to mouse emulation. It didn't take long before I was sold on this.

# Finding the right keyboard
There's so many open source keyboards with 36 keys out there, and to find the
right one for my preferences actually took weeks of browsing on /r/ErgoMechKeyboard,
kbd.news and github.

These were my goals:

  - Portable
  - 36 keys for the Miryoku layout
  - Aggressive pinkie stagger
  - Cheap
  - USB C
  - Easy to build
